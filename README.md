# Gender-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
The model is trained using various layers and the trained model is used for classifying the  picture as either male or female.
The trainingcode.txt is the file that contains the code which is used to generate the models for testing.The model.json and model.h5 is generated using that coded.One can add more layers inorder to increase the accuracy.
The png files shows the system implementation and the outputs obtained from the project.
